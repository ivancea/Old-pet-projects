# Old pet projects

All the code/projects I made when learning programming since ~2009. Most of them in C++.

Some of those projects were made when I was a beginner, other have different code styles, other are just little snippets, libraries...

There are projects of a lot of kinds here: hacking, cracking, services, protocols, file formats, bots, games, examples, custom implementations of a lot of things... Even useful programs.

Probably the 50% of them won't compile because I use in them my old "ivancea.h" library (a library full of little functions), or my "http.h"/"sockets.hpp" libraries (they are in a separate repository here).

English, spanish, camelCase, snake_case... Don't blame my old me, I'm a better person now, I swear!

From time to time, I like to check those projects. They are my time machine to my starts :D

I've had a lot of fun and learned a lot making all those little steps into the programming world, and I hope there is someone who finds something interesting or useful here!

## Structure

Most projects are in the root as single files. Some others are full projects within a folder. Most of those in C++.

Then, inside of the folder "otros" ("others") there are sub-folders for projects in other languages.
